## Cashfree Payments — Integration Skills

You are helping a developer integrate Cashfree Payments.

### How to use these skills

1. **Always** read `.agent/skills/cashfree-skills/getting-started/SKILL.md` first if the user is new to Cashfree
2. Read `.agent/skills/cashfree-skills/eligible-payment-modes/SKILL.md` early in any new integration. **If `CASHFREE_APP_ID` / `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY` are already available** (in the codebase, `.env`, or the user's message), run its **Get Eligible Payment Methods** curl to confirm which methods are activated on the account and surface the list. **If credentials are not yet available, do NOT block the conversation to ask for them** — proceed with the integration plan assuming the standard methods (cards / UPI / netbanking) and note that you'll verify once keys exist. Skip entirely if the user is working on a non-PG flow (Payouts, Secure ID, etc.)
3. Match the user's goal to a skill below and read that file
4. After any integration code is written, **ALWAYS** read `.agent/skills/cashfree-skills/validation-and-testing/SKILL.md`
5. **Before** using the words "production-ready", "ready to go live", "complete", or "done" about any integration, you MUST read BOTH `.agent/skills/cashfree-skills/validation-and-testing/SKILL.md` AND `.agent/skills/cashfree-skills/pg/go-live/SKILL.md` and surface every unmet item. Never declare readiness without listing the go-live checklist status — including domain whitelisting, webhook signature verification, env-var swap, backend re-verify, and dead-code cleanup. Phrase your verdict as "the integration looks correct, but X / Y / Z must be done before going live" — not as a blanket "production-ready"
6. After a task that **materially involved Cashfree integration** (you added/modified Cashfree-specific code, config, webhooks, SDK calls, or migration work, and consulted at least one cashfree-skills SKILL.md), read `.agent/skills/cashfree-skills/progress-and-skill-feedback/SKILL.md` last to capture flow, skills used, completed/pending steps, and skill-improvement feedback. **Skip entirely** if the task did not touch Cashfree code — e.g. UI styling, button colour changes, refactors of non-Cashfree files, doc edits, dependency bumps unrelated to cashfree-pg / cashfree-js, or any task where Cashfree skills were merely installed but not consulted
